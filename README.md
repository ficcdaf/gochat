# gochat

An end-to-end encrypted TUI chat app. GoChat is the Go client implementation of CloseCircle.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains a portion of what we submitted as the final course project for CISC 468 (Introduction to Cryptography). As such, GoChat, although secure (kind of the whole point), is not particularly convenient to use, simply because it only works over a LAN network and does not support concurrent conversations. 

This repository only contains code written by myself, and the final report co-authored by both of us. I chose not to include the Python client implemented by my partner simply because I want this to serve as a record of my own work and learning -- and it would feel dishonest to include code I was not involved in writing. 

Details regarding both clients and the project in general can be found in the [project report](./project_report.pdf).
